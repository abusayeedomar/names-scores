# Names Scores

Using names.txt, a text file containing over three-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 1071th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 1071 Ã— 53 = 56763.
